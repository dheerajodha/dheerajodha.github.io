# Portfolio
A website that would reflect my work!

To-Do:
- Homepage, having very brief overview of my coding journey
- About section, briefly tell about myself
- Resume section, where my resume will be hosted for anyone who's interested
- Projects section
- Blog section, where I'd share my blogs about anything that I'm learning or have learned.
  (Spoiler: There's going to be illustrations (thanks to Figma <3), as I need an excuse to draw something)
- Contact me section

Bonus Features/Idea:
- I'll be experimenting with Pastel colours.
- Let's see if I can make a animated version of me ALL BY MYSELF!
- Make it responsive or I should just say Bootstrap.
- I'll experiment with Neumorphic design wherever I can.
